This is an application used to display a portfolio of projects worked on by myself as well as an administrative page to add or delete projects from the database. One project's information has been included as a .sql file, while any number more may be generated using the input fields on the admin page.

It is themed after John Carpenter's classic 1988 film They Live starring "Rowdy" Roddy Piper, one of my all time favorite movies and perhaps Hollywood's greatest ever Marxist science fiction action movie starring a professional wrestler.
